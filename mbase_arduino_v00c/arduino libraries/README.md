In the Arduino IDE, navigate to Sketch > Include Library. At the top of the drop down list, select the option to "Add .ZIP Library".

You will be prompted to select the library you would like to add. Navigate to the .zip file's location and open it.

Return to the Sketch > Import Library menu. You should now see the library at the bottom of the drop-down menu. It is ready to be used in your sketch. The zip file will have been expanded in the libraries folder in your Arduino sketches directory.
